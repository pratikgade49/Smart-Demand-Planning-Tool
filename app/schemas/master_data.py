"""
Master Data schemas - currently not in use.

These schemas were planned for direct master data CRUD endpoints that are not yet implemented.
Master data is currently managed indirectly through the Field Catalogue finalization process,
which creates the master_data table based on the defined field structure.

Keeping this file as reference for future development of explicit master data endpoints.

# No active schemas - all master data operations are handled through field catalogue flow
